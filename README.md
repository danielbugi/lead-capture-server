Troubleshooting
Google Sheets Issues

Error: "The caller does not have permission"

Make sure you've shared your Google Sheet with the service account email
Check that the SPREADSHEET_ID in your .env file is correct
Verify that your Google Sheet has a tab named "Leads"

Error: "Invalid value at 'requests[0].add_sheet'"

This means the "Leads" sheet already exists
Either rename your existing sheet or modify the code

Email Issues

Error with Resend

Verify your API key is correct
Check that the NOTIFICATION_EMAIL is valid
Review the Resend dashboard for any delivery issues

CORS Issues

Error: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"

Make sure your FRONTEND_URL in .env matches your frontend's origin
Check that your frontend is using the correct API URL
